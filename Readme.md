## 📘 About the Repository

This repository contains various Prolog programs ranging from beginner to advanced level.  
Each program focuses on a specific Prolog concept such as:

- Facts and Rules  
- Queries and Inference  
- Recursion and Backtracking  
- List Manipulation  
- Arithmetic and Comparisons  
- Family Relationship Problems  
- AI Search Problems (e.g., Missionaries and Cannibals, 8-Puzzle)  
- Knowledge Base Design  
- Decision-Making and Logical Reasoning
